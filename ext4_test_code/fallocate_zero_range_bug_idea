Try to "#define ES_DEBUG__" in extents_status.c file.
then,
1. build kerlnel
2. run kvm instance.
3. manually use xfs_io to test it. see if any printk output helps.

There are several failures while running xfstests-bld(generic/075 and 091).
(reported by Ted)
COLLAPSE RANGE issue are mixed with ZERO RANGE issue as per format and mount
options.

First, list up issues like the following.
1. format with 1KB or 2KB block size.(075, 091 are failed, COLLAPSE RANGE issue).
2. mount -o dioread_nolock. (091 is failed, ZERO RANGE issue.)
   - As I know, Lukas is checking this issue.
3. mount -o data=journal. (091 is failed, ZERO RANGE issue.)
4. format with bigalloc. (075 and 091 are failed, COLLAPSE RANGE issue).
   - Once I would like to be disable COLLAPSE RANGE on ext4 with bigalloc feature
     till finding the root-cause. first, I need the time to understand bigalloc feature..
5. testing more.

 ext4: fix COLLAPSE_RANGE failure issue on ext4 with 1KB block size.
 ext4: fix ZERO_RANGE test failure in data journalling mode.
 ext4: disable COLLAPSE_RANGE for bigalloc.
