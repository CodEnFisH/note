There's something you should know about Heroku's handling of styles. You have to precompile your assets before you deploy the app. Reason for this is to give the app a consistent feel, and reduces load on the Heroku dynos

Here's how to set it up:

#config/environments/production.rb
config.serve_static_assets = true
config.assets.compile = true
When you want to deploy to Heroku, you just need to run:

rake assets:precompile RAILS_ENV=production
This will precompile your styles, allowing you to keep them consistent on Heroku & locally
