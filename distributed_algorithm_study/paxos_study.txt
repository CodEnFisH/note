paxos made simple.
2.1 The problem
  1. Only one value has been proposed can be chosen.
  2. only a single value can be chosen
  3. the process never learns a value has been chosen unless it actually has been chosen.
  
  Roles:
  Proposers, Accepters, Learners.

  We use the customary asynchronous, non-Byzantine model.
  
2.2 Choosing a value.

  (1) multiple acceptor.
    P1. An acceptor must accept the first proposal that it receives.
        We can allow multiple proposals to be chosen, but we must guarantee
that all chosen proposals have the same value.
   P2. If a proposal with value v is chosen, then every higher-numbered proposal
that is chosen has value v.
