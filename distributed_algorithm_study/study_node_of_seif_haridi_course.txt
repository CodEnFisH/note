Finished Lecture 1. Unit 1.

Lecture 1.1
 1.Two general problem: cannot be solved, on unreliable link.
 2.atomic broadcast <=> consensus.
Lecture 1.2 
 1. core problems: concensus, broadcast, leader election.
 
Lecture 2.0 Formal modeling system.
1. Modeling: different types of models: 
   a. discrete event models:
      Ofen described by state transition system: system evolves, moving from one state to another at discrete time steps.
   b. continuous models
      Often discribed by differential equations involving variables which can take real values.
2. Granularity of models.
   
Lecture 2.1 
1. What is distributed system? 
   a. bunch of nodes/processes
   b. sending messages over a network
   c. to solve a common goal (algorithm)
2. MOdeling a node.
  a. a single node has a bunch of neihbors: can send and recv mesgs. can do local computations.
  b. Model node by STATE TRANSITION SYSTEM (STS): like a finite state macine, except need not be finite, no input.
