 Modelling I: synchronous network model
 
 2.1 synchronous network 
 
 G(V,E)
 n: numver of V, |Vï½œ, number of notes in the network digrap.
 out-nbrs_i : outgoing neighbors of i.
 in-nbrs_i: incoming neigbors.
 distance(i,j): shortest directed path from i to j in G.
 diam: diameter, max distance(i,j) taken over all pairs.
 M: fixed message.
 
 each node i,contains following components:
 
 states_i,
 start_i,: a nonempty subset of states_i
 msgs_i,  message-generation function.
 tans_i
 
 
 channel,(link): (i,j)
 
 round: combination of two steps:(msg,trans)
 
 process halting, halting state.
 
 environment node:has connection to all nodes. can send wakeup msg.
 
 undirected graph
