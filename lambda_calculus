I study introduction to lambda calculus:

Notes:
1. Introduction. 
   a. Entscheidungs problem:solved by Turing and Church.  (Decision problem)
   b. reduction and functional programming.
   c. application and abstraction: p9
      The first basic operation of the lambda-calculus is "application" 
        F . A  or  FA
      abstraction:
        lambda x .M[x] denotes the function x -> M[x].
   d. free and bound variables.
       lambda x. yx    : x is bound and y is free variable.
       Then,
       yx(lambdax.x)[x:=N] === yN(lambda x.x)
   c. function of more arguments. Curring.
