You can also make each arity do something completely unrelated:

(defn weird-arity
  ([]
     "Destiny dressed you this morning my friend, and now Fear is
     trying to pull off your pants. If you give up, if you give in,
     you're gonna end up naked with Fear just standing there laughing
     at your dangling unmentionables! - the Tick")
  ([number]
     (inc number)))
