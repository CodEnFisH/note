Paper

abstract:
Bittable is a distributed storage system for managing structured data that is designed 
to scale to a very large size: petabytes of data across thousands of commodity servers.

2. Data Model
a bigtable is a sparse, distributed persistent multi-dimensional sorted map. 
The map is indexed by a row key, column key, and a timestamp.
each value in the map is an uninterpreted array of bytes.

Rows: the row keys in a table are arbitrary strings up to 64kb.

Column families.

Timestamps. each cell in a bigtable can contain multiple versions of the same data; 
  these versions are indexed by timestamp.
  
2 versions garbage collection: keep last n versions, keep last n days data.

3. API
